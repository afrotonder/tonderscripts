these few steps change the defaut grub background image at startup on ubuntu.
Works on unbuntu 16 and ubuntu 18. 

One day it chaged back to the default purple and i assume this was due to an
update. 


NOTE: You need to be sudo t do this ;
      The $ symbol is not part of the commands. it denotes the terminal ;

First open your terminal and with your preffered text editor(i choose nano
because its a fast edit) open the grub file: 

	$ sudo nano /etc/default/grub

Now add the following line anywhere you like in the file:

	GRUB_BACKGROUND="path/to/image.png"

Save the file according to your text editor and Boom. Restart your computer
to see results.

Thanks to justen_m on ubuntuforums.org for showing me and the world how this 
is done.
